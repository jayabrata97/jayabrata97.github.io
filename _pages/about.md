Hello! Wwlcome to my website.

This website is getting updated. Please stay tuned.

I am a graduate student at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), guided by Prof. Suresh Sundaram in the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab (AIRL). My path to IISc began with a B. Tech in Electrical Engineering in 2018, and now I'm driven by a passion for developing safe and robust algorithms for autonomous systems.

My graduate research focuses on predictive planning using Deep Learning, including a scalable uncertainty-aware algorithm (supported by the **Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship**). I honed my skills by transforming real-world autonomous system challenges into modular Machine Learning problems during my work at **WIPRO IISc Research Innovation Network (WIRIN)**. This project earned me the **RBCCPS PhD Fellowship** and the [best poster award at the Annual Symposium on Cyber-Physical Systems](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xYMF2gnnj_yXeIjtYvKkgS3vwTjEz-LQ/view).

My passion for problem-solving extends beyond robotic artificial intelligence. In the financial domain, I tackled the challenge of making decisions in volatile markets by building a probabilistic model for the WorldQuant Challenge, earning a [Gold Level certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wva-KfSz5JisRU_Gl4bEVTsuvLVmR-20/view). I am also interested in Natural Language Processing and Graph Machine Learning.
